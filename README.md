# Multi Phantom Face

This Mod adds the multi phantom face block. This block allows you to bundle multiple inventory in one block. This makes it possible to automate muli block machines with multiple input blocks with mods like Refined Storage.

This mod is currently only supported in Minecraft 1.12.2. This is a free time project of mine to enhance my personal game play experience. Therefore, I do not plan on further supporting this code base. If you want to support the code or update it to a newer version please feel free to fork this repository.

## Installation

This mod uses the Minecraft forge mod loader. To Install the mod drop the build .jar file into the mods/ folder.

## Build from Source

Please follow the instructions from minecraft forge: https://docs.minecraftforge.net/en/1.12.x/gettingstarted/
